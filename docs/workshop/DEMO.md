```
@gemini-cli I see the screenshot.png is missing. Please use MCP Playwright to navigate to the app and take a screenshot
and add it to the PR (both as a file, and uploaded in the GH conversation). Once done, and once verified its not an empty/blank image, label the issue with `app-has-screenshot`. I've seen quite a few blank images, not sure why; maybe you're not visiting the right URL? Or not waiting a couple of seconds for the app to properly spin up? Verify the screenshot is actually meaningful to a user.
