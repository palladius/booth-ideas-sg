# Investigation of gh-pages/palladius.json Recovery

## Objective
Recover the "fondue app" entry in `gh-pages/palladius.json` and remove unwanted "7.x pages" entries.

## Findings

Upon reviewing the `git log` for `gh-pages/palladius.json`, the following commit was identified as problematic:

*   **Commit `a579854` (feat(gh-pages): update palladius.json and add screenshot copy script)**:
    *   **Introduced unwanted changes**: This commit added several entries related to "7.x pages" (e.g., issues 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15).
    *   **Removed desired content**: Crucially, this commit also removed the "fondue-app" (issue 2), "cuckoo-clock-app" (issue 1), "pill-calendar-app" (issue 25), and "multiflag-app" (issue 21) entries.

*   **Commit `7e495fb` (feat: âœ¨ update gh-pages palladius.json)**:
    *   This commit, which occurred *after* `a579854`, added issues 46 and 35, and removed issue 20. These changes are considered valid and should be preserved.

## Proposed Action

The strategy is to:
1.  Revert the changes made by `a579854` specifically to `gh-pages/palladius.json` to restore the "fondue app" and remove the "7.x pages".
2.  Re-apply the valid changes from `7e495fb` (adding issues 46 and 35, removing issue 20) on top of the restored state.

This will effectively bring back the lost "fondue app" and remove the unwanted "7.x pages" while retaining the most recent valid updates to the `palladius.json` file.
