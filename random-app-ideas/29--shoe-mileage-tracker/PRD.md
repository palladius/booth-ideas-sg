# Product Requirements Document: Shoe Mileage Tracker

## 1. Overview & Vision

*   **Concept:** A simple web application to track the mileage of running shoes.
*   **Goal:** To help runners know when their shoes have reached the recommended mileage limit (500 miles) and should be replaced.
*   **Target Audience:** Runners who want to track the lifespan of their running shoes.

## 2. Core Functionality & Features

- [ ] Users can add a new shoe to their collection, providing a name for the shoe.
- [ ] Users can add mileage to each shoe.
- [ ] The application displays the current mileage for each shoe.
- [ ] The application displays a visual alert (e.g., changes color, shows an icon) next to any shoe that has crossed 500 miles.
- [ ] The data should be saved in the browser's local storage to persist between sessions.

## 3. Technical Implementation Constraints

The AI developer MUST adhere to the following constraints to ensure the project is self-contained and suitable for static hosting:

*   **Technology Stack:** Use only vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Do not use any frontend frameworks or libraries (like React, Vue, jQuery, etc.).
*   **File Structure:** The entire application must be contained within three separate files: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.
*   **Self-Contained:** The `index.html` file must correctly link the other two files. No external dependencies (like CDNs) should be used.
*   **Styling:** All styling must be in the `style.css` file. The design should be clean, modern, and responsive.
*   **Functionality:** All interactive logic must be in the `script.js` file, which will directly manipulate the DOM.
*   **Completeness:** The code must be a fully functional prototype of the core features listed above.
