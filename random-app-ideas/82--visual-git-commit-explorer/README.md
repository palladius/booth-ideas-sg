# Visual Git Commit Explorer

This is a simple web application built with Astro that visualizes a Git commit history.

## Development

To run this application locally, you need to have Node.js and npm installed.

1.  Navigate to this directory: `cd random-app-ideas/82--visual-git-commit-explorer`
2.  Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Start the development server: `npm run dev`

The application will be available at `http://localhost:4321`.

## Mock Data

This application currently uses mock data from a `public/git-history.json` file to display the commit history. It does not interact with a real Git repository.
