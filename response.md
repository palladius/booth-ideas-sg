Hello @ricky,

I have created a new Astro project for your Pill Calendar App. I was not able to update the issue title as requested, but I have created the `PRD.md` file and the project structure.

Here is the plan for the implementation of the app:

### Plan

- [ ] Create the basic UI for the application, including a calendar view and a form to add new pills.
- [ ] Implement the logic to add and store pill configurations.
- [ ] Implement the logic to display the pills on the calendar.
- [ ] Implement the logic to prompt the user to take their pills.
- [ ] Implement the logic to send reminders if the user does not take their pills.
- [ ] Style the application to be clean, modern, and responsive.

Please let me know if you approve this plan, and I will start working on the implementation.
