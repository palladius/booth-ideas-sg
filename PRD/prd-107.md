# Prime Factorization Utility PRD

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the Product Requirements for the "Prime Factorization Utility," a web-based application designed to provide users with a fast and accurate way to determine the prime factors of a given integer. The project aims to simplify a fundamental mathematical task, making it accessible to a wide audience, from students to professionals, by offering a straightforward interface and immediate results.

## 2. Problem Statement

Users often encounter the need to find the prime factors of numbers, whether for educational purposes (e.g., homework, teaching aids), computational tasks (e.g., cryptography, number theory research), or general curiosity. Existing methods for prime factorization often involve manual trial-and-error, which is time-consuming and prone to human error, especially with larger numbers. Online calculators exist but can sometimes be cumbersome, slow, or lack specific user-friendly features. The primary pain point is the lack of a quick, reliable, and user-friendly tool that can instantly provide accurate prime factorizations without requiring complex software installations or extensive mathematical knowledge. This leads to frustration, wasted time, and potential inaccuracies in various tasks.

## 3. Target Audience

The primary users of the Prime Factorization Utility include:

*   **Students (Middle School to University Level):**
    *   **Motivations:** To check homework answers, understand the concept of prime factorization, prepare for exams, and explore number theory concepts.
    *   **Goals:** Quickly verify factorization results, learn through accurate examples, and save time on tedious manual calculations.
