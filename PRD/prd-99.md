# BikeTrip Andermatt & Switzerland: Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a new mobile application, tentatively named "BikeTrip Andermatt & Switzerland." The primary purpose of this project is to develop a specialized tool for cyclists to plan, track, and analyze their bike trips, with a particular focus on the scenic and challenging terrains of Andermatt and wider Switzerland. The application aims to provide a comprehensive, intuitive, and engaging platform that leverages advanced features like AI-powered effort estimation and seamless integration with existing cycling ecosystems, enhancing the overall cycling experience for enthusiasts.

## 2. Problem Statement

Avid cyclists, especially those venturing into mountainous and scenic regions like Andermatt and Switzerland, face several challenges with existing generic mapping and fitness applications:

*   **Lack of Specialization**: Generic mapping tools often lack granular detail and specialized features relevant to bike trip planning, such as specific bike-friendly routes, elevation profiles tailored for cycling, or insights into terrain difficulty from a cyclist's perspective.
*   **Inaccurate Effort Estimation**: Current tools provide basic metrics but often fail to accurately estimate the total physical effort required for a ride, particularly when considering complex factors like elevation changes, surface types, and personal fitness levels. This leads to under-preparation or overexertion.
*   **Fragmented Experience**: Cyclists often use multiple applications for planning, tracking, and sharing, leading to a fragmented and inefficient workflow. The lack of a unified platform specifically designed for detailed bike trip logistics creates friction.
*   **Discovery Limitations**: Finding and discovering new, suitable, and challenging routes in specific regions can be cumbersome without dedicated, curated content.
*   **Lack of Engagement**: While tracking is available, the experience often lacks personalized insights and a thematic appeal that resonates with the passion of cycling.

Our product addresses these pain points by offering a specialized, integrated, and intelligent solution.
