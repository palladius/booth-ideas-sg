# Product Requirements Document: NexaLogistics B2B App

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for NexaLogistics, a new B2B logistics application designed to revolutionize supply chain management. The primary purpose of NexaLogistics is to provide businesses with a centralized, intelligent platform to streamline shipping, track inventory, and manage deliveries with real-time updates and advanced analytics. By addressing the critical inefficiencies and fragmentation prevalent in current logistics operations, NexaLogistics aims to significantly enhance operational efficiency, reduce logistical costs, and improve delivery reliability for businesses of all sizes.

## 2. Problem Statement
Many businesses today grapple with the complexities of managing their logistics, which often leads to significant inefficiencies, fragmented processes, and substantial operational costs. Key pain points include:

*   **Lack of Real-time Visibility**: Organizations struggle to gain a holistic, real-time view of their entire supply chain, from inventory levels to shipment locations, leading to reactive decision-making and poor customer communication.
*   **Manual & Fragmented Processes**: Reliance on manual data entry, spreadsheets, and disparate systems results in errors, duplicate efforts, and a lack of data consistency. This fragmentation prevents seamless information flow and operational continuity.
*   **Inefficient Route Planning**: Suboptimal route planning leads to increased fuel consumption, longer delivery times, higher labor costs, and environmental impact. Without dynamic optimization, businesses cannot adapt quickly to changing traffic conditions or sudden order modifications.
*   **Delayed Deliveries & High Costs**: Inefficient management directly translates to delivery delays, missed deadlines, and increased operational expenditure due to rework, expedited shipping, and customer service interventions.
*   **Inventory Discrepancies**: Poor inventory tracking and management lead to stockouts, overstocking, and difficulty in fulfilling orders accurately, impacting both revenue and customer satisfaction.
*   **Limited Data for Decision Making**: Businesses often lack comprehensive data and analytics capabilities to identify bottlenecks, forecast demand, and make strategic improvements to their logistics operations.
