# Product Requirements Document: Italian Emoji Tic-Tac-Toe

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for a mobile application delivering a novel and engaging twist on the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Our goal is to create a digital game that stands out through its unique thematic elements and customizable user experience, specifically by integrating fun, custom Italian-themed emojis as game pieces. This project aims to refresh a timeless game, offering a lighthearted and culturally rich casual gaming experience to a broad audience.

## 2. Problem Statement
Existing digital Tic-Tac-Toe games, while functional, largely suffer from a lack of unique thematic elements and engaging customization options. They often present a generic, uninspired visual experience that quickly leads to player fatigue and disinterest. Players are looking for more than just a functional game; they desire personalization, novelty, and an experience that feels fresh and memorable. The absence of such features results in a missed opportunity to truly engage casual mobile gamers who appreciate lighthearted, themed experiences and a fresh take on classic games. Without a distinct identity or interactive customization, these games fail to capture and retain user attention in a competitive mobile gaming market.

## 3. Target Audience
The primary users for this product are **Casual Mobile Gamers**. These individuals typically enjoy quick, accessible, and entertaining games that can be played in short bursts throughout their day. Their motivations include:
*   **Seeking lighthearted entertainment**: They want games that are fun without requiring a significant time commitment or deep strategic learning.
*   **Appreciating novelty and themes**: They are drawn to games that offer a unique visual style, a fresh concept, or a specific theme that resonates with them.
*   **Desiring personalization**: They enjoy being able to customize aspects of their gaming experience, making it feel more personal and unique.
*   **Nostalgia for classic games**: They have an inherent fondness for simple, universally recognized games like Tic-Tac-Toe but are open to modern interpretations.

Their goals are to:
*   Find a quick, enjoyable distraction.

## 5. Features & Requirements

### 5.1 Core Game Loop
*   **Description**: The fundamental Tic-Tac-Toe gameplay, following standard rules on a 3x3 grid.
*   **Requirements**:
    *   Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O) take turns placing their chosen emoji on an empty square.
    *   The first player to get three of their emojis in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
    *   If all 9 squares are filled and no player has three in a row, the game is a draw.
    *   Clear visual indication of whose turn it is.
    *   Ability to start a new game after completion.
*   **Importance**: This is the foundation of the game; it must be perfectly functional and intuitive.

### 5.2 Custom Italian Emojis
*   **Description**: Players can select from various themed sets of unique, fun Italian-themed emojis to represent their game pieces.
*   **Requirements**:
    *   At least 3 distinct sets of Italian-themed emojis available at launch (e.g., 'Foodie Fun' with pizza/pasta, 'Landmarks' with Colosseum/Vespa, 'Daily Life' with Moka pot/espresso cup).
    *   Each set must contain two distinct emojis (one for Player 1, one for Player 2).
    *   A dedicated 'Customization' or 'Emojis' screen for selection.
    *   Visual preview of selected emojis within the game board.
*   **Importance**: This is the core differentiator and driver of user value and cultural appeal.

### 5.3 Single-Player Mode (vs. AI)
*   **Description**: Players can challenge an AI opponent with adjustable difficulty levels.
*   **Requirements**:
    *   Options for at least three AI difficulty levels: 'Easy', 'Medium', and 'Hard'.
    *   'Easy' AI should make occasional suboptimal moves to allow for player wins.
    *   'Medium' AI should provide a reasonable challenge for casual players.
    *   'Hard' AI should employ a strategy (e.g., minimax algorithm) to play optimally, making it difficult to beat.
    *   Seamless transition from AI selection to game start.
*   **Importance**: Allows players to enjoy the game alone, practice, or seek a challenge, increasing replayability.

### 5.4 Two-Player Mode (Local Pass-and-Play)
*   **Description**: Two players can play against each other on the same device.
*   **Requirements**:
    *   Simple setup, allowing players to quickly start a game by passing the device.
    *   Clear indication of whose turn it is for both players.
    *   No network connectivity required.
*   **Importance**: Facilitates social interaction and on-the-go play with friends or family.

### 5.5 Winning/Losing/Draw Animations
*   **Description**: Engaging visual and auditory feedback for game outcomes.
*   **Requirements**:
    *   Unique, lighthearted animations for a win, loss, and draw (e.g., winning emojis dancing, losing emojis looking sad, draw emojis shrugging).
    *   Accompanying sound effects.
    *   Animations should be brief and non-intrusive.
*   **Importance**: Enhances the celebratory and lighthearted nature of the game, improving user engagement.

### 5.6 Basic Settings
*   **Description**: Users can adjust fundamental game settings.
*   **Requirements**:
    *   Toggle for background music on/off.
    *   Toggle for sound effects on/off.
    *   Link to privacy policy/terms of service.
*   **Importance**: Provides control over the gaming environment, catering to individual preferences.

## 6. User Stories
*   **As a casual gamer**, I want to play a quick game of Tic-Tac-Toe against an AI opponent so I can pass the time during my commute.
*   **As a player**, I want to choose fun Italian emojis for my game pieces (e.g., a pizza slice for me and a pasta bowl for my friend) so I can personalize my game experience and express my love for Italian culture.
*   **As a friend playing with another friend**, I want to easily start a two-player game on a single device so we can have a quick, fun competition together.
*   **As a new player**, I want clear visual cues for whose turn it is and intuitive tap controls so I can learn and play the game effortlessly.
*   **As a returning player**, I want to see a cheerful animation and hear a celebratory sound when I win a game so I feel a sense of accomplishment and enjoyment.

## 7. Technical Considerations

### 7.1 Proposed Tech Stack
*   **Frontend/Cross-Platform Development**: **React Native** or **Flutter**. These frameworks allow for a single codebase to deploy to both iOS and Android, accelerating development and reducing maintenance overhead. Given the game's relatively simple UI/UX, either would be highly efficient.
*   **Game Engine (Alternative for more complex animations)**: If more intricate animations or physics were desired in future iterations, **Unity 2D** could be considered, but it's likely overkill for the initial MVP.
*   **AI Implementation**: A **Minimax algorithm** for the 'Hard' AI, with simpler heuristic-based logic for 'Easy' and 'Medium' difficulties. This can be implemented directly within the chosen frontend framework (e.g., JavaScript/Dart).
*   **Asset Management**: Use vector-based graphics (SVGs) for emojis where possible to ensure scalability and crispness across various device resolutions, along with optimized PNGs for other UI elements.
*   **State Management**: Standard state management solutions provided by React Native (Context API, Redux) or Flutter (Provider, Bloc) will be sufficient for managing game state and user preferences.
*   **Deployment**: Standard app store deployment processes for Apple App Store and Google Play Store.

### 7.2 Architecture
*   **Client-Side Only**: For the initial release, the game will be entirely client-side, requiring no external server or backend. This simplifies development, reduces costs, and ensures offline playability.
*   **Modular Design**: The codebase should be structured with clear separation of concerns (e.g., UI components, game logic, AI logic, asset loading) to facilitate future updates and maintenance.

## 8. Potential Risks & Mitigations

### 8.1 Risk: Low User Adoption Due to Game Simplicity
*   **Description**: Tic-Tac-Toe is a very simple game, and some users might find it too basic, leading to low initial downloads or poor retention.
*   **Mitigation**:
    *   **Strong Marketing Focus**: Emphasize the unique Italian emoji theme and its charming, lighthearted appeal in all marketing materials.
    *   **Thematic Updates**: Plan for future updates that introduce new emoji packs, background themes, or even slight rule variations (e.g., larger grid options as a premium feature) to keep the game fresh.
    *   **Social Sharing**: Implement easy sharing of game outcomes (e.g.,
