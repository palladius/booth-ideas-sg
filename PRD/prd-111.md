## 1. Introduction

Lake Geneva (Lac LÃ©man) is a prominent location for water sports, particularly kitesurfing. However, the localized and often unpredictable wind patterns present a significant challenge for enthusiasts. The "Leman Wind" application aims to address this by providing a dedicated, highly accurate, and real-time wind data and forecasting solution specifically for Lake Geneva. This mobile application will empower kitesurfers to make informed decisions, enhance safety, and maximize their enjoyment on the water by offering unparalleled insights into current and future wind conditions.

## 2. Problem Statement

Kitesurfers on Lake Geneva currently face significant challenges in obtaining reliable, hyper-local wind information. Generic weather applications often lack the granularity and accuracy required for specific spots on such a large and complex body of water, which is prone to microclimates and localized wind effects. 

**Key pain points include:**

*   **Inaccurate General Forecasts:** Standard meteorological models often fail to capture the nuances of Lake Geneva's wind patterns, leading to unreliable predictions for specific launching spots.
*   **Lack of Real-time Data:** Kitesurfers often arrive at a spot only to find conditions are drastically different from what was expected, leading to wasted time, frustration, and potential safety risks.
*   **Safety Concerns:** Unforeseen wind shifts or stronger-than-expected gusts can lead to dangerous situations, especially for less experienced riders or when conditions change rapidly.
*   **Inefficient Planning:** Without precise data, planning a kitesurfing session becomes a gamble, reducing the frequency and enjoyment of the sport.
*   **Dispersion of Information:** Kitesurfers often rely on word-of-mouth, outdated forums, or multiple unreliable sources to gather information, leading to confusion and inconsistency.

This product aims to centralize and enhance wind intelligence, providing a definitive source of truth for kitesurfers on Lake Geneva.

The primary target audience for the Leman Wind application is **kitesurfers on Lake Geneva**. This group can be further segmented:

*   **The Enthusiastic Regular:** These are individuals who kitesurf frequently, are keen on optimizing their sessions, and prioritize maximizing their time on the water. They are tech-savvy, likely own smartphones, and are willing to pay for a premium service that enhances their hobby.
    *   **Motivations:** Maximize water time, ensure safety, find the best conditions, plan efficiently.
    *   **Goals:** Consistently identify optimal wind spots and times, avoid wasted trips, improve skill progression with consistent sessions.
