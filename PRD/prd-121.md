# Product Requirements Document: Event DocDigest

## 1. Introduction

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the development of "Event DocDigest," an innovative application designed to streamline meeting preparation and follow-up. Event DocDigest addresses the common challenge faced by professionals who organize and attend calendar events laden with attached Google Docs. Currently, there is no efficient native solution to summarize and distribute the essence of these documents to all invitees. Event DocDigest will leverage AI to automatically generate concise summaries of all Google Docs attached to a calendar event and send them as an email to all invitees. The application will also provide a comprehensive user interface for managing sent emails, reviewing logs, rescheduling, and setting up daily digests, all presented within a user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing interface. The primary goal is to enhance meeting preparedness, ensure crucial information reaches all participants, and significantly reduce the manual effort involved in document sharing.

## 2. Problem Statement

In today's fast-paced professional environment, meetings are often accompanied by a multitude of supporting documents, frequently stored as Google Docs and attached to calendar events. While Google Calendar facilitates the linking of these documents, it lacks a mechanism for efficiently distributing their key contents to all participants. This leads to several significant pain points:

*   **Manual Information Overload**: Event organizers spend excessive time manually opening each attached document, identifying key information, and then compiling summaries or links to share with attendees. This process is tedious, time-consuming, and prone to human error or oversight.
*   **Inefficient Meeting Preparation**: Invitees often struggle to prepare adequately for meetings due to the sheer volume of documents. They may not have the time to read every attached Google Doc in its entirety, leading to attendees being underprepared and less engaged during discussions.
*   **Missed Information & Context**: Critical details within documents can be overlooked if invitees only skim them or miss a document entirely. This lack of shared context can hinder effective decision-making and collaborative outcomes during and after the meeting.
*   **Poor Follow-up**: After a meeting, ensuring everyone has access to the most pertinent document information for follow-up actions is challenging without a consolidated summary, leading to potential delays or miscommunications.
*   **Lack of Centralized Communication**: There is no single, automated channel to ensure all invitees receive consistent, summarized information about linked documents, requiring organizers to resort to fragmented communication methods.

Event DocDigest aims to solve these problems by automating the summarization and distribution of GDocs content, thereby improving efficiency, preparedness, and overall meeting effectiveness.

## 3. Target Audience

The primary target audience for Event DocDigest includes any professional who regularly organizes or attends calendar events, particularly those within organizations that heavily utilize Google Workspace. This encompasses:

*   **Event Organizers/Meeting Hosts**: Project Managers, Team Leads, Department Heads, Executive Assistants, and anyone responsible for orchestrating meetings and ensuring participants are well-informed. Their motivation is to facilitate more productive meetings, reduce their administrative burden, and ensure all attendees have necessary context efficiently.
*   **Meeting Invitees/Attendees**: Team members, stakeholders, clients, and collaborators who attend meetings and need to quickly grasp the essential information from shared documents to contribute effectively. Their goal is to prepare efficiently, understand the core topics without deep-diving into every document, and stay updated on important context.
*   **Teams and Organizations**: Companies and departments striving for increased productivity, improved internal communication, and optimized meeting workflows. They seek tools that enhance collaboration and reduce wasted time in administrative tasks.

These users are typically tech-savvy, accustomed to Google Workspace, and value efficiency and effective communication. They are motivated by the desire to save time, reduce cognitive load, and contribute more meaningfully to their work, thereby making their professional lives easier and more productive.
