# Product Requirements Document: ARIMA Time Series Forecasting Application

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for a new ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) time series forecasting application. The primary purpose of this product is to provide businesses and analysts with an intuitive, powerful tool to predict future trends and make data-driven decisions. By offering flexible forecasting windows and clear visual representations, this application aims to democratize access to advanced forecasting capabilities, moving beyond the complexity often associated with traditional methods.

## 2. Problem Statement
Businesses and analysts today face significant challenges in accurately predicting future trends, which is crucial for strategic planning, resource allocation, and risk management. Existing forecasting methods often suffer from one or more of the following pain points:

*   **Complexity and Barrier to Entry**: Many powerful statistical forecasting techniques, like ARIMA, require deep statistical knowledge, making them inaccessible to a broader audience of business professionals. Tools that implement these methods can be overly complex or lack user-friendly interfaces.
*   **Lack of Flexibility**: Business needs are dynamic. A fixed forecasting horizon might not be suitable for all scenarios. Users often require the ability to quickly adjust the forecasting window (e.g., from quarterly to monthly, or specific durations up to a year) to respond to evolving market conditions or internal planning cycles.
*   **Data Overload and Interpretation Difficulty**: While data is abundant, converting raw time series data into actionable insights remains a hurdle. Visualizing forecasts clearly and understanding their implications without extensive manual processing is a common struggle.
*   **Time Consumption**: Manually setting up and running forecasting models, especially when needing to experiment with different parameters or data sets, can be incredibly time-consuming, diverting valuable analyst resources from higher-level strategic work.
*   **Reliability Concerns**: Without proper model validation and a clear understanding of assumptions, the reliability of forecasts generated by less sophisticated tools can be questionable, leading to poor decision-making.

This product aims to address these pain points by offering an accessible, flexible, and visually intuitive ARIMA forecasting solution.

## 3. Target Audience
The primary target audience for this application consists of data analysts, business planners, and financial professionals who require reliable and dynamic time series forecasts to support their decision-making processes. These users typically operate within various industries, including retail, finance, supply chain, marketing, and operations.

**Key Characteristics and Motivations:**

*   **Data-Driven Decision Makers**: They rely on quantitative insights to formulate strategies, identify opportunities, and mitigate risks.
*   **Time-Sensitive**: They need quick and efficient ways to generate forecasts, often under tight deadlines.
*   **Seeking Accuracy and Reliability**: While not necessarily statisticians, they understand the importance of robust models and seek tools that provide accurate predictions.
*   **Value Flexibility**: The ability to customize forecasting parameters, especially the time horizon, is critical for their diverse planning needs.
*   **Appreciate Clear Visualizations**: They prefer tools that present complex data and model outputs in an easily digestible, visual format for faster interpretation and communication to stakeholders.
*   **Goals**: To predict sales, demand, stock prices, website traffic, resource needs, and other critical business metrics accurately; to optimize inventory, allocate budgets, plan marketing campaigns, and assess financial performance; to present compelling, data-backed recommendations to management.

## 4. Goals/Objectives
The overarching goal is to empower users with accessible and accurate future trend predictions, leading to more informed strategic decisions. Our specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) objectives are:

*   **User Value (Accessibility & Flexibility)**: Achieve a **75% user satisfaction rate** with the forecasting window customization feature within 6 months post-launch, as measured by in-app surveys and user feedback.
*   **User Value (Accuracy & Insights)**: Ensure that generated forecasts provide an average **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) at least 10% lower** than simple moving average baselines on a diverse set of real-world time series data, validated internally and externally, within 3 months of launch.
*   **Business Value (Adoption & Engagement)**: Attain **1,000 monthly active users (MAU)** within the first 12 months post-launch, demonstrating strong market adoption.
*   **Business Value (Efficiency)**: Reduce the average time taken for an analyst to generate a 12-month forecast by **50%** compared to manual or less integrated methods, as evidenced by user testimonials and benchmark studies within 9 months.
*   **Innovation in AI**: Incorporate advanced ARIMA model selection techniques (e.g., auto_arima) and provide clear model diagnostics, aiming for **80% of users** to report confidence in the model's choices based on provided diagnostic information within 1 year.

## 5. Features & Requirements

### 5.1. Core Feature: ARIMA Forecasting Engine
*   **Description**: The application's core will be a robust ARIMA model implementation capable of automatically identifying optimal (p, d, q) parameters or allowing manual specification. It must handle various types of time series data, including those with trends and seasonality.
*   **Importance**: This is the fundamental component that provides the analytical power for accurate time series predictions, directly addressing the problem of complex forecasting methods.
*   **Functional Requirements**: 
    *   R1.1: The system shall implement a seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model to account for seasonality.
    *   R1.2: The system shall offer an 'auto-ARIMA' feature to automatically determine optimal (p, d, q) and (P, D, Q, S) parameters based on information criteria (e.g., AIC, BIC).
    *   R1.3: Users shall have the option to manually input ARIMA parameters.
    *   R1.4: The engine shall handle missing values in input data gracefully (e.g., imputation options or intelligent skipping).
    *   R1.5: The engine shall provide model diagnostics (e.g., ACF/PACF plots of residuals, Ljung-Box test results) to assess model fit.
    *   R1.6: The engine shall calculate standard error bands for forecasts, representing confidence intervals.

### 5.2. Core Feature: Customizable Forecasting Window
*   **Description**: Users will be able to easily define the length of the forecasting period, up to a maximum of 12 months (or equivalent periods like 52 weeks, 365 days, depending on data granularity).
*   **Importance**: This feature directly addresses the pain point of rigid forecasting horizons, offering the flexibility required for diverse business planning needs and contributing significantly to user value.
*   **Functional Requirements**:
