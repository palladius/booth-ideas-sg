## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the Product Requirements for HydroTrack, a mobile application designed to simplify and improve daily water intake tracking.

## 2. Problem Statement
Many individuals struggle to consistently track their daily water intake, despite understanding its crucial role in maintaining overall health. Current methods often involve manual logging on paper, using generic note-taking apps, or relying on inconvenient, overly complex, or visually unappealing tracking tools.

*   **Lack of Personalization**: Generic recommendations often fail to account for individual needs, activity levels, or environmental factors.
