# Product Requirements Document: Swiss Indulgence Calorie Counter

## 1. Introduction

The Swiss Indulgence Calorie Counter is an innovative mobile and web application designed to address the specific challenge of tracking calorie intake when enjoying traditional Swiss fondue, raclette, and accompanying wine. This project aims to empower health-conscious individuals to savor these rich culinary experiences without losing sight of their dietary goals. By providing a user-friendly interface with a distinct and engaging aesthetic, the app will offer precise calorie estimations, enabling users to maintain awareness and control over their consumption.

## 2. Problem Statement

For many health-conscious individuals, enjoying indulgent meals like Swiss fondue and raclette, often paired with wine, presents a significant challenge in accurately tracking caloric intake. The nature of these dishes – communal dining, varying portion sizes, diverse cheese types, and continuous consumption over extended periods – makes traditional calorie counting methods difficult and often inaccurate. Current generic food tracking apps may lack specific data for these niche foods or fail to provide a seamless, enjoyable logging experience. This leads to frustration, a sense of losing control over dietary goals, and potentially overconsumption due to a lack of real-time awareness. The pain points include:

*   **Inaccurate Estimations:** Difficulty in guesstimating portions of melted cheese, various accompaniments, and wine. 
*   **Lack of Specific Data:** Generic apps often don't have granular nutritional data for the wide array of Swiss cheeses used in fondue/raclette or their typical serving sizes.
*   **Cumbersome Logging:** Existing methods are often clunky and interrupt the social dining experience.
*   **Loss of Control:** Users feel disempowered when they can't effectively monitor their consumption during enjoyable but calorie-dense meals.
*   **Lack of Engagement:** Current tracking methods can be bland and uninspiring, especially for specialty foods.

## 3. Target Audience

The primary users of the Swiss Indulgence Calorie Counter are individuals who appreciate and frequently enjoy Swiss fondue, raclette, and wine, but also prioritize their health and dietary management. They are typically:

*   **Health-Conscious Diners:** Individuals who actively monitor their caloric intake, macros, or overall diet for weight management, fitness, or general well-being.
*   **Food Enthusiasts:** People who enjoy culinary experiences but seek tools to balance indulgence with health.
*   **Social & Engaged:** Users who often partake in social gatherings where fondue and raclette are served and desire a discreet, easy-to-use tracking solution.
*   **Tech-Savvy:** Individuals comfortable with mobile applications and expecting a modern, intuitive user interface.
*   **Motivation:** Their main motivation is to enjoy these traditional meals without guilt or detrimental impact on their health goals. They want to be empowered with accurate information to make informed choices, rather than abstaining entirely or guessing. They seek a tool that fits seamlessly into their lifestyle and offers a pleasant user experience.
