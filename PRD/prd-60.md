# Product Requirements Document: Digital Tic-Tac-Toe

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for developing a digital version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. The primary purpose of this project is to provide users with a simple, engaging, and accessible way to pass time, challenge their minds, and enjoy a familiar game experience. It aims to offer quick entertainment through single-player (AI) and two-player (local) modes, leveraging the universal appeal and simplicity of Tic-Tac-Toe.

## 2. Problem Statement
In an increasingly fast-paced world, users frequently seek simple, yet engaging, forms of entertainment to fill brief moments of downtime. The pain points addressed by this product include:
*   **Boredom and Downtime:** Users often find themselves with short periods of time to kill (e.g., waiting in line, during commutes) and desire a quick, easily accessible form of mental engagement.
*   **Lack of Accessible, Familiar Entertainment:** While complex games abound, there's a consistent demand for universally recognized and simple games that require minimal learning curves, offering immediate gratification.
*   **Desire for Nostalgia:** Many users have fond memories of playing Tic-Tac-Toe, seeking a digital rendition that evokes this nostalgia without over-complication.
*   **Limited Social Interaction in Short Bursts:** For users sharing a device, finding a quick, shared activity can be challenging. A simple local multiplayer game offers this immediate social connection.
