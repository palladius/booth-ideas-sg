# Product Requirements Document: Chronic Disease Management Application

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for a new mobile application designed to empower patients with specific chronic diseases to better manage their conditions. The application aims to provide an integrated, personalized, and supportive platform that bridges the gap between patient self-management and professional healthcare guidance. By leveraging cutting-edge technology, including AI, we seek to improve treatment adherence, enhance patient engagement, and ultimately drive better health outcomes for individuals living with long-term illnesses.

## 2. Problem Statement
Patients suffering from specific chronic diseases, such as diabetes, hypertension, or cardiovascular conditions, face significant challenges in effectively managing their health. The current healthcare landscape often lacks integrated tools, leading to fragmented care and suboptimal patient engagement. Key pain points include:

*   **Lack of Personalized Support:** Generic treatment advice often fails to account for individual patient needs, lifestyles, and unique responses to therapy.
*   **Poor Treatment Adherence:** Forgetting medication, missing appointments, or not following dietary/exercise recommendations are common, leading to worsening conditions and increased healthcare costs.
*   **Ineffective Symptom Monitoring:** Patients struggle to consistently track symptoms, making it difficult for both themselves and their healthcare providers to identify trends, react to changes, and assess treatment efficacy.
*   **Limited Communication Channels:** Existing communication between patients and their healthcare teams can be infrequent and reactive, often only occurring during scheduled appointments, which leaves patients feeling unsupported between visits.
*   **Information Overload & Misinformation:** Patients often rely on disparate sources for health information, leading to confusion or exposure to unreliable advice.
*   **Burden on Caregivers:** Caregivers often bear a significant responsibility in managing a patient's condition, but may lack the tools to do so efficiently and collaboratively with healthcare providers.

This fragmented approach contributes to preventable complications, reduced quality of life, and a significant burden on healthcare systems.

## 3. Target Audience
The primary users of this product are individuals diagnosed with specific chronic diseases, their informal caregivers, and their healthcare providers. Each group has distinct motivations and goals:

*   **Primary Patients (e.g., Adults with Diabetes, Heart Disease, COPD):**
    *   **Motivations:** Desire to live a healthier, more independent life; reduce disease symptoms and progression; understand their condition better; feel supported in their health journey.
    *   **Goals:** Consistently take medication; track symptoms and vital signs accurately; adhere to dietary and exercise plans; easily communicate concerns to their care team; access reliable health information; improve overall quality of life.
*   **Caregivers (e.g., Family members, Spouses):**
    *   **Motivations:** Support their loved one's health; reduce their own stress and burden; ensure effective disease management.
    *   **Goals:** Monitor patient's adherence to treatment; assist with symptom tracking; facilitate communication with the healthcare team; access educational resources to better assist the patient.
*   **Healthcare Providers (e.g., Physicians, Nurses, Specialists, Dietitians):**
    *   **Motivations:** Improve patient outcomes; streamline clinical workflows; gain deeper insights into patient's day-to-day health; enhance patient engagement and education.
    *   **Goals:** Receive real-time, actionable patient data; provide personalized recommendations; monitor treatment adherence remotely; improve communication efficiency; reduce administrative burden related to patient follow-ups.
