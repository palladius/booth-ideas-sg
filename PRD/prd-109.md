# Product Requirements Document: Urban Bathroom Finder App

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a mobile application designed to alleviate the common problem of finding suitable and available public restrooms in urban environments. The "Urban Bathroom Finder" app aims to provide a seamless, stress-free experience for users by leveraging location intelligence, user-defined preferences, and AI-powered dynamic routing. Our goal is to become the go-to solution for anyone in need of a restroom in the city, enhancing convenience and reducing anxiety associated with this prevalent urban challenge.

## 2. Problem Statement

Finding a clean, accessible, and available public restroom in a bustling city is a significant and frequent pain point for millions of people. This struggle leads to: 

*   **Stress and Anxiety:** Users often experience discomfort and stress, particularly when in unfamiliar areas, during travel, or with urgent needs (e.g., parents with young children, individuals with medical conditions).
*   **Inconvenience and Lost Time:** People waste valuable time searching aimlessly, often having to detour significantly or enter establishments solely for restroom access, which can be awkward or unfeasible.
*   **Hygiene Concerns:** Without reliable information, users might settle for unsanitary options, posing health risks and an unpleasant experience.
*   **Accessibility Barriers:** Individuals with disabilities or specific needs (e.g., changing tables for infants) face exacerbated challenges in locating suitable facilities.
*   **Lack of Real-time Information:** Existing solutions or general map applications often lack up-to-date information on availability, cleanliness, or specific amenities, leading to frustrating dead ends.
