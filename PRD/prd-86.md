# Product Requirements Document: Simple Digital Canvas App

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the Simple Digital Canvas App. The aim of this project is to develop an intuitive, web-based application that provides users with a straightforward platform for basic digital painting. It will feature a square canvas, a selection of colored brushes, and the ability to paint using a mouse or finger, with a primary focus on ease of use and quick export functionality. This application addresses the growing need for accessible creative tools that do not overwhelm users with complex features.

## 2. Problem Statement

The digital art landscape is often dominated by sophisticated software that, while powerful, presents a steep learning curve and high resource demands. Many casual users, beginners, or those simply seeking a quick creative outlet find existing tools overly complex, intimidating, or too expensive for their needs. This creates a significant barrier to entry for individuals who wish to engage in basic digital drawing, doodle, or express simple creative ideas without investing significant time or money into mastering professional-grade applications. Users currently lack a truly simple, accessible, and free tool for basic digital painting that allows for immediate creation and effortless sharing or saving of their artwork. The pain points include: complexity of interfaces, resource intensiveness of software, lack of quick output options, and a general overwhelming feeling when confronted with advanced features for simple tasks.

## 3. Target Audience

The primary target audience for the Simple Digital Canvas App includes individuals of all ages who seek a straightforward and intuitive platform for casual digital drawing and immediate output. This encompasses:

*   **Children and Young Students:** Looking for a fun, easy-to-use tool for creative expression and basic art activities without needing parental supervision for complex software.
*   **Casual Users and Hobbyists:** Individuals who enjoy doodling, sketching simple ideas, or creating quick digital notes without the overhead of professional art software.
*   **Beginners in Digital Art:** Those new to digital painting who need a low-barrier-to-entry platform to experiment and get comfortable with digital tools before moving to more advanced applications.
*   **Educators:** Seeking a simple, web-based tool for art lessons or creative exercises in a classroom setting.
*   **Anyone needing quick visual communication:** Users who want to quickly draw a diagram, concept, or simple image to share.

Their motivations include a desire for creative expression, a need for simplicity, quick gratification, and the ability to easily share their creations. Their goals are to effortlessly create simple digital artworks and easily share or save their creations without technical hassle.

## 4. Goals/Objectives

### Business Goals

*   **User Adoption:** Achieve 10,000 unique monthly active users within the first 6 months post-launch, demonstrating initial market interest and product stickiness. (Note: While business value is low without monetization, this goal focuses on establishing a user base for potential future strategies).
*   **User Satisfaction:** Achieve an average user satisfaction score of 4 out of 5 stars based on in-app feedback or surveys within the first 9 months, indicating the app meets the core need for simplicity and usability.

### User Goals

*   **Effortless Creation:** Enable users to start drawing on the canvas within 5 seconds of loading the application.
*   **Easy Output:** Allow users to export their finished artwork as a PNG image in a single click or tap.

## 5. Features & Requirements

### 5.1 Canvas

*   **Description:** A central, interactive drawing area where users create their artwork.
*   **Functional Requirements:**
    *   **Fixed Square Size:** The canvas shall be a fixed square aspect ratio (e.g., 800x800 pixels) to ensure consistency across devices and simplify design. This fixed size avoids complex resizing logic and ensures optimal performance for a simple app.
    *   **Clear Canvas:** A button or option shall be provided to completely clear the canvas, removing all existing strokes and resetting it to a blank state, allowing users to start fresh.
*   **Importance:** The canvas is the core workspace, and a fixed size simplifies development and ensures a consistent user experience.

### 5.2 Brushes & Colors

*   **Description:** Tools for users to apply color strokes to the canvas.
*   **Functional Requirements:**
    *   **Color Palette:** A set of at least 8 distinct, pre-defined colors (e.g., red, blue, green, yellow, black, white, purple, orange) shall be easily accessible for selection. The specific color choices should be vibrant and primary-focused initially.
    *   **Brush Selection:** Users shall be able to click/tap on a color from the palette to select it as their active drawing color. The selected color should be visually indicated.
    *   **Fixed Brush Size:** Initially, there will be one fixed brush size to maintain simplicity and focus on the core painting mechanic. Future iterations could explore variable sizes, but for MVP, simplicity is key.
*   **Importance:** A basic set of colors and a simple brush allow for fundamental creative expression without overwhelming choices.

### 5.3 Painting Functionality

*   **Description:** The core interaction mechanism for drawing on the canvas.
*   **Functional Requirements:**
    *   **Mouse Input:** Users shall be able to draw on the canvas by holding down the left mouse button and dragging the cursor.
    *   **Touch Input (Finger Painting):** Users on touch-enabled devices (tablets, smartphones) shall be able to draw by touching and dragging their finger across the canvas.
    *   **Smooth Strokes:** Drawing strokes should appear smooth and responsive, without noticeable lag.
*   **Importance:** This enables the primary user interaction and allows the app to be accessible across various devices.

### 5.4 Undo/Redo Functionality

*   **Description:** Allows users to correct mistakes or revert changes made on the canvas.
*   **Functional Requirements:**
    *   **Undo Button:** A dedicated button shall allow users to revert the last drawing action (e.g., a single brush stroke or a clear canvas action). The undo stack should support at least 10 previous actions.
    *   **Redo Button:** A dedicated button shall allow users to re-apply an action that was previously undone.
*   **Importance:** Essential for a positive user experience, reducing frustration, and encouraging experimentation by providing a safety net for errors.

### 5.5 Export to PNG

*   **Description:** Enables users to save their completed artwork.
*   **Functional Requirements:**
    *   **One-Click Export:** A clearly labeled "Export to PNG" button shall be available. When clicked, it will trigger a download of the current canvas content as a PNG file.

## 6. Out of Scope

The following features are explicitly out of scope for the initial version of the Simple Digital Canvas App to maintain simplicity and focus on the core user experience:

*   **Variable Brush Sizes:** Only a single, fixed brush size will be available.
*   **Advanced Color Options:** No color picker, custom color creation, or gradients will be included.
*   **Layers:** The application will not support layers. All drawing will be done on a single layer.
*   **Image Imports:** Users will not be able to import images onto the canvas.
*   **Text Tool:** There will be no functionality to add text.
*   **Saving/Loading Projects:** The app will not save project files; only direct export to PNG is supported.
*   **User Accounts:** No user registration or login functionality will be implemented.

## 7. Success Metrics

The success of the Simple Digital Canvas App will be measured by the following key performance indicators (KPIs):

*   **User Engagement:**
    *   **Monthly Active Users (MAU):** Target of 10,000 MAU within 6 months of launch.
    *   **Session Duration:** Average session duration of at least 3 minutes.
*   **Feature Adoption:**
    *   **Export Rate:** At least 50% of active sessions result in a PNG export.
    *   **Undo/Redo Usage:** Track the frequency of undo/redo button clicks to understand user reliance on these features.
*   **User Satisfaction:**
    *   **User Feedback:** Collect user feedback through a simple, non-intrusive survey or rating system. Target a 4 out of 5-star average rating.
