# Product Requirements Document: GitHub Public Repo Tracker

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for a new application designed to provide a centralized and efficient way for users to monitor open issues and pull requests (PRs) across multiple public GitHub repositories. The primary goal is to streamline the tracking process for developers, contributors, and open-source enthusiasts who frequently engage with or follow various public projects on GitHub, offering a unified dashboard experience.

## 2. Problem Statement
The current landscape for tracking activities in public GitHub repositories is fragmented and inefficient. Users often find themselves: 
*   **Constantly switching tabs:** Navigating between numerous repository pages to check for new issues or PRs is time-consuming and disruptive.
*   **Missing critical updates:** Without a consolidated view, it's easy to overlook important discussions or newly opened tasks that are relevant to their interests or contributions.
*   **Lack of a unified overview:** There is no single, easy-to-digest dashboard that provides a real-time snapshot of all open tasks across a curated list of repositories.
*   **Difficulty prioritizing:** When monitoring many projects, it's challenging to get a quick sense of which issues or PRs require immediate attention without deep-diving into each repo individually.

This fragmentation leads to decreased productivity, potential oversight of important developments, and a generally frustrating user experience for those who need to stay abreast of multiple open-source projects.

## 3. Target Audience
The primary target audience for this application includes:

*   **Open-Source Contributors:** Developers actively contributing to multiple public open-source projects who need to quickly identify new tasks, review outstanding PRs, or respond to issues in their areas of expertise.
    *   *Motivations:* Staying productive, ensuring timely contributions, collaborating effectively.
    *   *Goals:* Efficiently finding relevant tasks, tracking their own PRs/issues, keeping up with project progress.
*   **Project Maintainers (of public repos):** Individuals overseeing several public repositories who require a high-level overview of ongoing development, potential bottlenecks, or community engagement.
    *   *Motivations:* Managing project health, identifying areas needing attention, fostering community engagement.
    *   *Goals:* Quick oversight of all open items, identifying trends, delegating tasks effectively.
*   **Developers/Researchers Monitoring Trends:** Users who follow specific technologies, libraries, or frameworks by tracking their respective public GitHub repositories, needing to be aware of new features, bugs, or discussions.
    *   *Motivations:* Learning, staying updated with technology, identifying potential solutions/problems for their own work.
    *   *Goals:* Quick access to status updates, understanding community activity around specific projects.
*   **Team Leads/Managers:** Individuals who manage teams contributing to or utilizing various public GitHub projects, needing a consolidated view of relevant external activities.
    *   *Motivations:* Resource planning, dependency tracking, understanding external project progress.
    *   *Goals:* Streamlined information gathering, improved team awareness of external factors.

All these users share a common goal: to gain a quick, centralized, and efficient understanding of development progress and pending tasks across their monitored public GitHub projects without the overhead of manual navigation.

## 4. Goals/Objectives

### Business Goals
*   **User Acquisition:** Achieve 1,000 active monthly users within the first 6 months post-launch.
*   **User Retention:** Maintain a monthly user retention rate of over 70% after the initial 3 months.
*   **Scalability Proof:** Demonstrate the application's ability to handle monitoring up to 50 public repositories per user within the first year.
*   **Monetization Readiness:** Identify potential premium features (e.g., private repo support, advanced analytics) and define a roadmap for a subscription model by the end of Q4 post-launch.

### User Goals
*   **Efficiency:** Reduce the average time users spend checking open issues and PRs across multiple repositories by 50% compared to manual browsing within 3 months of regular use.
*   **Centralized View:** Provide a single dashboard where users can view all open issues and PRs from their specified repositories.
*   **Timely Updates:** Ensure users receive near real-time updates (within 5 minutes of changes on GitHub) for all monitored items.
*   **Ease of Use:** Maintain a high user satisfaction score (CSAT) of 4.5/5 or higher for the ease of adding/managing repositories and navigating the dashboard.

## 5. Features & Requirements

### 5.1 Repository Management
*   **Feature:** Allow users to add and remove public GitHub repositories to their monitoring list.
    *   **Description:** Users can input a GitHub repository URL or `owner/repo` string to add it to their personalized dashboard. They can also easily remove repositories they no longer wish to track.
    *   **Importance:** This is fundamental for users to customize their view and focus on relevant projects.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   Input field for GitHub repository URL or `owner/repo` format.
    *   Validation to ensure the repository is public and accessible.
    *   Confirmation message upon successful addition/removal.
    *   Display of currently monitored repositories in a clear list.

### 5.2 Consolidated Dashboard View
*   **Feature:** Display all open issues and pull requests from all added repositories in a single, unified list.
    *   **Description:** The main dashboard will present a chronological or sortable list of all open issues and PRs, regardless of their originating repository.
    *   **Importance:** This directly addresses the problem of fragmentation, providing the core value proposition of the application.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   Each item (issue or PR) must display its title, originating repository, status (open), and a link to the original GitHub page.
    *   Indication if the item is an issue or a pull request.
    *   Date of last update/creation for each item.
    *   Paginating or infinite scrolling for large lists of items.

### 5.3 Filtering and Sorting
*   **Feature:** Enable users to filter and sort the consolidated list of issues and PRs.
    *   **Description:** Users should be able to narrow down or order the displayed items based on various criteria.
    *   **Importance:** This enhances usability and allows users to quickly find specific information or prioritize their tasks.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   **Filters:** By repository, by type (issue/PR), by author, by labels (if fetched).
    *   **Sorting:** By creation date (newest/oldest), by last updated date (newest/oldest), by repository name.

### 5.4 Real-time Updates
*   **Feature:** Ensure the dashboard data is kept up-to-date with changes on GitHub.
    *   **Description:** The application will periodically fetch updates from GitHub to reflect any new issues, PRs, or changes in status for existing ones.
    *   **Importance:** Users rely on current information for effective monitoring and decision-making.
*   **Requirements:**

    *   Indicator for when the data was last updated.
    *   Ability for users to manually trigger a refresh.

### 5.5 Direct GitHub Navigation
*   **Feature:** Provide direct links to the original issue or PR page on GitHub.
    *   **Description:** Each item displayed in the dashboard will be clickable, taking the user directly to its corresponding page on GitHub.com.
    *   **Importance:** Users will often need to view the full context, comment, or interact with the item, which is best done on GitHub itself.
*   **Requirements:**
    *   All issue and PR titles must be hyperlinks.
    *   Links should open in a new browser tab.
