# Product Requirements Document: PrimeFactorizer App

## 1. Introduction

The PrimeFactorizer App is a proposed web-based tool designed to simplify and democratize the process of prime factorization. This document outlines the vision, features, and technical considerations for building an accessible, efficient, and user-friendly platform where individuals can effortlessly find the prime factors of any given integer, including large numbers, and explore fascinating mathematical properties through an engaging 'I feel lucky' feature.

## 2. Problem Statement

Prime factorization, while a fundamental concept in mathematics with critical applications in fields like cryptography and number theory, often presents a significant challenge. Users, ranging from students to advanced researchers, frequently encounter several pain points:

*   **Manual Tedium and Error Proneness:** Factoring large numbers by hand is incredibly time-consuming, tedious, and highly susceptible to errors, making it impractical for most real-world scenarios.
*   **Lack of Accessible Tools:** While specialized software and calculators exist, many are complex, require installation, or are not readily available as a simple, intuitive web application for quick, on-demand use. Users often struggle to find a straightforward online tool that can handle numbers of significant size without requiring deep technical knowledge.
*   **Performance Limitations:** Generic calculators or basic online tools often hit performance bottlenecks when attempting to factorize numbers with many digits, leading to long wait times or outright failures.
*   **Educational Barrier:** Students learning about prime numbers and factorization may lack an interactive tool to verify their work or explore the concept with diverse examples, hindering their understanding and engagement.

This product aims to address these pain points by providing a fast, accurate, and user-friendly solution.
