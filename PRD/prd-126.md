# Product Requirements Document: Threes JavaScript Web Game

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the Product Requirements Document (PRD) for the development of a JavaScript-based web game, inspired by the acclaimed numerical puzzle game, Threes. The primary goal is to create an engaging, accessible, and mentally stimulating puzzle experience directly within the user's web browser. By faithfully replicating the core mechanics of combining numbers (starting with ones and twos to form threes, then doubling), we aim to provide a high-quality, free-to-play game that offers quick and satisfying logic challenges for a broad audience.

## 2. Problem Statement
In today's fast-paced digital environment, players frequently seek engaging, simple, and mentally stimulating puzzle games that can be enjoyed casually during short breaks or periods of downtime.

## 5. Features & Requirements

### 5.1 Core Gameplay Mechanics
*   **Feature**: **4x4 Grid Board**
    *   **Description**: The game will be played on a standard 4x4 grid, where all tiles reside and move.
    *   **Importance**: This established grid size is fundamental to the Threes-like gameplay and strategic depth.
*   **Feature**: **Tile Generation**
    *   **Description**: New tiles (initially 1s and 2s) will appear randomly on the board after each valid move, typically from the side opposite the player's swipe direction. Higher tiles (3s, 6s, 12s, etc.) will emerge from merges.
    *   **Importance**: Ensures continuous gameplay and introduces new challenges, requiring players to adapt their strategy.
*   **Feature**: **Swipe Input Recognition**
    *   **Description**: The game must accurately detect user swipes (up, down, left, right) on both desktop (mouse drag) and mobile (touch swipe) interfaces.
    *   **Importance**: Provides the primary, intuitive control mechanism for moving tiles and interacting with the game.
*   **Feature**: **Tile Movement & Merging Logic**
    *   **Description**: When a swipe occurs, all tiles slide in the specified direction until they hit the edge of the board or another tile. Crucially, 1s and 2s merge to form a 3. Subsequent merges occur between two identical tiles (e.g., 3+3=6, 6+6=12, 12+12=24, etc.). Merges can only happen once per tile per move.
    *   **Importance**: This is the core puzzle mechanic, defining the strategy and challenge of the game.
*   **Feature**: **Score Tracking**
    *   **Description**: The game will maintain a running score, incrementing based on the value of tiles created from merges (e.g., merging two 3s adds 6 to the score, merging two 6s adds 12, etc.).
    *   **Importance**: Provides immediate feedback on player progress and is key for competitive self-improvement.
*   **Feature**: **Game Over Condition**
    *   **Description**: The game ends when the board is full, and no valid moves (swipes that result in either tile movement or a merge) are possible.
    *   **Importance**: Defines the end of a game session and prompts the player to restart or review their score.

### 5.2 User Interface & Experience (UI/UX)
*   **Feature**: **Visual Feedback for Merges and Movement**
    *   **Description**: Tiles should animate smoothly when moving and merging, with distinct visual effects (e.g., color change, slight glow, particle effect) to indicate a merge.
    *   **Importance**: Enhances player understanding of game mechanics, provides satisfying feedback, and improves overall game polish.
*   **Feature**: **Current Score Display**
    *   **Description**: A prominently displayed area for the player's current score during gameplay.
    *   **Importance**: Essential for players to track their progress and set new goals.
*   **Feature**: **High Score Persistence**
    *   **Description**: The highest score achieved by the player will be saved locally (e.g., using `localStorage`) and displayed prominently on the game over screen or main menu.
    *   **Importance**: Encourages replayability and fosters a sense of achievement and competition with oneself.
*   **Feature**: **Restart Game Option**
    *   **Description**: A clear and easily accessible button to restart the game at any time, especially on the game over screen.
    *   **Importance**: Allows players to quickly begin a new session after a game over or if they wish to abandon a current game.
*   **Feature**: **Basic Tutorial/Help Screen**
    *   **Description**: A concise, optional tutorial or help screen explaining the basic rules of the game (1+2=3, doubling merges, swipe mechanics).
    *   **Importance**: Ensures new players can quickly understand the game without prior knowledge, reducing friction to adoption.

### 5.3 Technical & Performance
*   **Feature**: **Responsive Design**
    *   **Description**: The game layout and controls must adapt gracefully to different screen sizes and orientations (desktop, tablet, mobile).
    *   **Importance**: Ensures a consistent and enjoyable experience across the diverse devices of our target audience.
*   **Feature**: **Smooth Animations & Performance**
    *   **Description**: All tile movements and merges should be rendered smoothly at a high frame rate (e.g., 60 FPS) without lag, even on moderately powered devices.
    *   **Importance**: A critical factor in user satisfaction and perceived game quality; janky animations detract significantly from the experience.

## 7. Technical Considerations

### High-Level Technical Approach
The game will be developed as a single-page application (SPA) using modern web technologies, prioritizing performance, responsiveness, and maintainability.

### Proposed Tech Stack:
*   **Frontend Language**: **JavaScript (ES6+)** - The core logic for game mechanics, UI updates, and animations.
*   **Markup**: **HTML5** - For the main game canvas and structural elements.
*   **Styling**: **CSS3** - For styling, responsive layouts, and basic UI animations.
*   **Game Engine/Library**: **Phaser 3 or Pixi.js** - These libraries offer robust capabilities for 2D rendering, animation, input handling, and scene management, significantly accelerating game development compared to plain Canvas API. Phaser is more feature-rich for game-specific concerns, while Pixi.js is a powerful rendering engine if more custom game logic is desired. Initial preference leans towards Phaser for its comprehensive game development features.
*   **Build Tool**: **Webpack or Vite** - For bundling JavaScript modules, optimizing assets, and providing a development server with hot module replacement.
*   **Version Control**: **Git** (e.g., hosted on GitHub/GitLab) - For collaborative development and code management.
*   **Local Storage**: Browser's `localStorage` API for persisting high scores and game settings.

### Architecture Choices:
*   **Modular Component Design**: Organize game components (e.g., `Board`, `Tile`, `InputManager`, `ScoreManager`) into separate modules for better maintainability and testability.
*   **Event-Driven System**: Utilize an event bus or observer pattern for communication between different game modules (e.g., `TileMergeEvent`, `GameOverEvent`).
*   **Canvas Rendering**: The game board and tiles will be rendered using HTML5 Canvas, managed by the chosen game library (Phaser/Pixi.js) to ensure smooth animations and complex visual effects.
*   **Accessibility**: While the
