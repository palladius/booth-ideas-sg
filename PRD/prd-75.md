# Product Requirements Document: Intelligent Daily Agenda App

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a new application designed to significantly enhance the daily scheduling experience for Google Calendar users. By leveraging advanced Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities, the app will provide intelligent daily agenda summaries and smart, context-aware alarms. A core focus will be on delivering a visually stunning and intuitive user interface, reminiscent of the Apple Calendar aesthetic, with vibrant colors and meticulously crafted rounded event visuals. The ultimate goal is to empower users with a clearer, more engaging, and proactively managed daily plan, thereby boosting productivity and reducing scheduling-related stress.

## 2. Problem Statement

In an increasingly busy world, individuals often struggle with effectively managing their daily schedules. Standard digital calendars, while functional, present several pain points:

*   **Information Overload**: Users are often faced with a dense list of events, requiring manual parsing to understand key commitments, priorities, and conflicts for the day. This consumes valuable time and cognitive effort.
*   **Lack of Contextual Understanding**: Calendar entries rarely provide summaries or insights beyond the basic title and description, leaving users to connect the dots themselves regarding preparation or importance.
*   **Generic Reminders**: Traditional alarms are often static and non-adaptive, failing to account for real-world factors like travel time, context of the meeting, or potential preceding tasks. This can lead to missed deadlines or tardiness.
*   **Unengaging UI**: Many calendar applications offer a purely functional, often monotonous, user interface that doesn't inspire engagement or enjoyment in planning the day.
*   **Cognitive Load**: The constant mental effort required to interpret schedules and set appropriate reminders contributes to daily stress and reduces overall productivity.

This product aims to address these challenges by transforming the calendar experience from a passive repository of events into an active, intelligent, and delightful daily assistant.
