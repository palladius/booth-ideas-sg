# WindWise Léman: Hyper-Localized Wind Forecast for Lake Geneva

## 1. Introduction

The WindWise Léman project aims to develop a cutting-edge mobile application providing hyper-localized, real-time, and predictive wind forecasts specifically for Lake Geneva (Lac Léman). Leveraging advanced AI/ML models and a blend of data sources, this application will address the critical need for accurate wind intelligence among water sports enthusiasts, enhancing safety, improving activity planning, and ultimately enriching their experience on the lake.

## 2. Problem Statement

Lake Geneva, with its unique and complex topography—enclosed by mountains and surrounded by varied landscapes—creates highly localized and often unpredictable wind conditions. Standard meteorological forecasts, which operate on broader geographical grids, consistently fail to capture these microclimates, leading to significant pain points for lake users:

*   **Safety Risks:** Sudden, unpredicted wind shifts or increases in speed can put sailors, windsurfers, kitesurfers, and even swimmers in dangerous situations, leading to accidents, capsizes, or being stranded.
*   **Suboptimal Planning:** Without precise wind information, enthusiasts struggle to plan their activities effectively. They may miss optimal conditions, arrive at spots with unsuitable winds, or bring the wrong equipment, leading to frustration and wasted time.
*   **Lack of Trust:** Existing general weather apps often provide contradictory or inaccurate wind data for specific lake spots, eroding user trust and forcing them to rely on anecdotal evidence or unreliable sources.
*   **Economic Impact:** Businesses reliant on lake activities (e.g., sailing schools, rental shops, event organizers) suffer when participants cannot reliably plan, leading to cancellations or decreased engagement.

WindWise Léman seeks to solve these problems by offering unparalleled precision and reliability, tailored specifically to the intricacies of Lake Geneva.

## 3. Target Audience

The primary target users of WindWise Léman are individuals who engage in wind-dependent water sports and activities on Lake Geneva. This includes, but is not limited to:

*   **Sailors (Cruisers & Racers):** Motivated by safety, optimal performance in regattas, efficient route planning, and enjoyable cruising. They need precise wind direction and speed for sail trim and tactical decisions.
*   **Windsurfers & Kitesurfers:** Driven by the pursuit of ideal wind strength and direction for their respective sports. They require real-time gust information and short-term forecasts to choose the right gear and spots.
*   **Stand-Up Paddlers & Kayakers:** Primarily concerned with safety and ease of paddling, needing to avoid strong headwinds or unexpected changes that could make their activity challenging or dangerous.
*   **Rowers:** Seeking calm conditions for training or competition, needing to know if the lake will be smooth enough.
*   **Paragliders & Hang Gliders (operating near the lake):** While not directly on the water, wind conditions over and around the lake significantly impact their activity, requiring precise wind speed and direction at various altitudes.
*   **Boat Charter & Tour Operators:** Need reliable forecasts for passenger safety and activity scheduling.
*   **Local Residents & Tourists:** Those planning any lake-related leisure activities where wind might be a factor.

Their motivations include maximizing enjoyment, ensuring safety, optimizing performance, and making efficient use of their time. Their goals are to accurately predict conditions, select the best spots, and avoid unpleasant or dangerous surprises.
