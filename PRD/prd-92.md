# Product Requirements Document: Mallorca Cyclist Companion App

## 1. Introduction

The Mallorca Cyclist Companion App is a mobile application designed to be the ultimate planning and tracking tool for cyclists exploring the beautiful and challenging terrain of Mallorca. This product aims to empower cyclists with advanced capabilities to plan routes, track key performance metrics, accurately estimate ride effort, and seamlessly integrate with their existing cycling ecosystem, specifically Strava. By providing a dedicated, region-specific solution, we intend to enhance the overall cycling experience in Mallorca, making trips more efficient, enjoyable, and data-driven.

## 2. Problem Statement

Cyclists, particularly those planning trips to or regularly riding in regions like Mallorca, face several significant pain points:

*   **Lack of Region-Specific Planning Tools:** Existing general-purpose cycling apps often lack detailed, localized insights and curated route suggestions specific to Mallorca's unique topography, famous climbs, and cycling-friendly infrastructure (e.g., bike shops, specific cafes). Users spend excessive time cross-referencing maps, forums, and various apps to gather fragmented information.
*   **Ineffective Effort Estimation:** Accurately estimating the total physical effort required for a given route, considering factors like elevation gain, distance, weather, and personal fitness, is challenging. Cyclists often under- or overestimate, leading to either exhaustion, uncompleted rides, or missed opportunities for more challenging routes. Current tools offer basic metrics but lack intelligent, personalized effort predictions.
*   **Fragmented Data and Planning Experience:** Users typically juggle multiple apps for route planning, ride tracking, and social sharing (e.g., Google Maps for general navigation, Strava for tracking, a separate app for elevation profiles). This fragmented experience is inefficient and reduces the enjoyment of the planning process.
*   **Absence of Integrated Metrics:** While distance and elevation are standard, combining these with a projected 'effort' score that considers personal attributes and route specifics is a significant gap. This makes pre-ride strategy difficult.

## 3. Target Audience

The primary target audience for the Mallorca Cyclist Companion App is:

*   **Avid Cyclists (Road and Gravel):** Individuals who regularly cycle, prioritize fitness, and seek to optimize their riding experience. They are comfortable with technology and often use existing cycling apps.
