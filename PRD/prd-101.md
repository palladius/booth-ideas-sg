# Product Requirements Document: Disney Character Bilingual Name Explorer

## 1. Introduction

The Disney Character Bilingual Name Explorer is a mobile application designed to bridge the linguistic gap for Disney fans worldwide. This product aims to provide a comprehensive, easy-to-use directory of Disney characters, showcasing their official names in both English and Italian. The primary goal is to enhance the user experience for Disney enthusiasts and multilingual parents by offering a fun, educational, and reliable resource for cross-lingual character identification, fostering a deeper appreciation for Disney's global narrative.

## 2. Problem Statement

Disney characters are beloved globally, but their names often undergo localization to resonate with local audiences. This practice, while culturally enriching, creates a significant pain point for fans attempting to identify or discuss characters across different languages. Specifically, fans often struggle to find the official, accurate names for Disney characters in both English and Italian, leading to confusion and frustration. For example, iconic characters like Huey, Dewey, and Louie are known as "Qui, Quo, Qua" in Italian, and finding a consolidated, authoritative source for such translations is challenging. Existing resources are often fragmented, incomplete, or unofficial, making cross-lingual identification an arduous task. This lack of a centralized, user-friendly platform hinders multilingual communication among fans, complicates language learning for children, and reduces the overall enjoyment of Disney content across cultural borders.

The primary target audience for the Disney Character Bilingual Name Explorer includes:

*   **Disney Enthusiasts:** Fans who possess a deep love for Disney characters and want to explore the nuances of their identities across different languages. Their motivation is driven by curiosity, a desire for comprehensive knowledge, and the joy of discovering new facets of their favorite characters.
*   **Multilingual Parents:** Parents raising children in bilingual or multicultural households who wish to introduce Disney characters to their children in both English and Italian.
