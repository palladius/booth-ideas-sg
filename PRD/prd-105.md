# Product Requirements Document: Prime Factorization Utility

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a simple web application designed to facilitate the prime factorization of large integers. The primary goal is to provide an accessible, efficient, and user-friendly online utility that simplifies a fundamental mathematical task for a diverse audience, from students to professionals. This product aims to fill a gap for users who need quick, accurate factorization without relying on complex software or manual computations.

## 2. Problem Statement

Prime factorization, while a core concept in mathematics, becomes increasingly challenging and time-consuming as numbers grow larger. Existing solutions often fall into one of two categories: rudimentary calculators that struggle with large numbers or highly specialized mathematical software that requires significant expertise to operate. Users, particularly students, educators, and researchers, frequently encounter pain points such as:

*   **Manual Effort:** Factoring large numbers by hand is prone to error, extremely tedious, and impractical.
*   **Lack of Accessibility:** Many online tools are either slow, inaccurate, or have restrictive input limits, making them unsuitable for significant numbers.
*   **Complexity of Advanced Tools:** Specialized mathematical software (e.g., Wolfram Mathematica, MATLAB) can factor large numbers but comes with a steep learning curve and often a high cost, making it inaccessible for casual or educational use.
*   **Verification:** There's a constant need for a quick and reliable method to verify prime factors, whether for academic assignments, research, or exploratory number theory.

The absence of a straightforward, high-performance web-based utility for prime factorization forces users to waste time, compromises accuracy, and hinders learning and research.

## 3. Target Audience

The Prime Factorization Utility is designed for a broad but specific user base that requires efficient prime factorization capabilities. Our primary users include:

*   **Students (High School & University):**
    *   **Motivation:** To check homework, understand prime factorization concepts, and verify solutions for number theory, algebra, or cryptography courses.
    *   **Goals:** Quick and accurate results for assigned problems; a tool to aid learning.
*   **Educators (Teachers & Professors):**
    *   **Motivation:** To generate examples for lectures, create problem sets, and demonstrate factorization principles in real-time.
    *   **Goals:** A reliable and quick tool for classroom demonstrations and material preparation.
*   **Mathematicians & Researchers (Amateur & Professional):**
    *   **Motivation:** To quickly test hypotheses related to number theory, explore properties of large primes, or verify factors in preliminary research without setting up complex computational environments.
    *   **Goals:** A fast, precise utility for exploratory work and quick validation of numerical properties.
*   **Professionals in Related Fields (e.g., Cryptography Enthusiasts):**
    *   **Motivation:** To understand the practical implications of prime factorization in fields like RSA encryption (though not for breaking actual systems), or for educational purposes related to computational security.
    *   **Goals:** A hands-on tool to explore the mathematical underpinnings of cryptographic algorithms.

All target users share the common need for a simple, fast, and accurate way to determine the prime factors of integers, especially those that are too large for mental calculation or standard calculators.
