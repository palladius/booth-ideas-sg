# Product Requirements Document: Portugal Meteo Forecast

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for the 'Portugal Meteo Forecast' mobile application. The primary purpose of this project is to develop a visually engaging, highly accurate, and distinct weather forecasting application specifically tailored for users within Portugal. Leveraging a unique green/red color scheme, the app aims to provide clear, actionable meteorological information to residents and tourists alike, enhancing their daily planning, travel, and outdoor activities.

## 2. Problem Statement

Users in Portugal currently face a challenge in finding a weather application that is both visually engaging and provides highly localized, precise forecasts for the country's diverse geographical regions. Existing weather apps often present generic data, lack a distinct user interface, or fail to cater specifically to the nuanced meteorological conditions prevalent across Portugal's microclimates. This leads to several pain points:

*   **Lack of Visual Distinction:** Many weather applications feature similar, often uninspiring, designs, making it difficult for users to quickly discern critical information or differentiate between apps.
*   **Generic Forecasts:** Standard weather services often provide broad regional forecasts, which can be inaccurate for specific towns, valleys, or coastal areas within Portugal, leading to incorrect planning decisions.
*   **Inefficient Information Digestion:** Users spend more time interpreting complex data or sifting through irrelevant information, especially when needing quick updates for immediate planning.
*   **Unaddressed Local Needs:** The unique weather patterns influencing daily life, agriculture, and tourism in Portugal are not always adequately addressed by global weather platforms.
*   **Impact on Planning:** Inaccurate or unclear forecasts can lead to sub-optimal decisions regarding commutes, outdoor events, travel arrangements, and safety during adverse weather conditions.

## 3. Target Audience

The primary target audience for the Portugal Meteo Forecast application includes any individual in Portugal, encompassing both residents and tourists, who seeks quick, accurate, and visually appealing meteorological updates. This audience can be further segmented:

*   **Portuguese Residents (Daily Planners):**
    *   **Motivations:** Need reliable weather information for daily routines, commuting, social engagements, and planning local outdoor activities (e.g., beach trips, hiking, sports).
    *   **Goals:** Quick access to hyper-local forecasts for their specific town or region, proactive alerts for significant weather changes, and an app that feels intuitive and distinctively Portuguese.
*   **Tourists in Portugal (Travel Planners):**
    *   **Motivations:** Require accurate forecasts to plan sightseeing, outdoor excursions, beach days, and travel logistics across different regions of Portugal.
    *   **Goals:** Easy-to-understand weather at a glance, multi-language support, and location-aware forecasts to adapt their itineraries on the go.
*   **Outdoor Enthusiasts (Specific Activity Planners):**
    *   **Motivations:** Demand detailed metrics like wind speed, UV index, and precipitation probability for activities such as surfing, cycling, hiking, or sailing.
    *   **Goals:** Highly precise real-time data and future predictions that directly impact their specific outdoor pursuits.

All segments share a common desire for an application that is reliable, easy to use, and offers a visually refreshing alternative to existing options.
