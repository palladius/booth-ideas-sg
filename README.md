# Idea to Code: Euro Cloud Summit Demo

Welcome! This repository contains the source code for the "Idea to Code" demo application, showcased at the
Google Cloud booth during the Euro Cloud Summit in Switzerland.

This interactive demo showcases how generative AI can dramatically accelerate the software development lifecycle,
taking a simple idea from concept to a functional, deployable prototype in minutes.

## ðŸ’¡ Idea Gallery

All the ideas generated during the event are available for you to explore in our interactive gallery.

## Accessing Your Generated Code

For visitors at the Euro Cloud Summit:

1.  When you submit your idea through our application, a new **GitHub Issue** is automatically created in this repository.
2.  Our [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-github-actions/run-gemini-cli) will process your idea, generate the code, and push it to a **new branch**.
3.  The [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-github-actions/run-gemini-cli) will then post a **comment in your GitHub Issue** containing the name of the branch and step-by-step instructions on how to clone the repository and access your code.
4.  Simply find your issue in the [Issues tab](https://github.com/pauldatta/booth-ideas-sg/issues) and follow the instructions in the comments.

## Application

The web application itself is a Next.js project located in the `ideas-app/` directory. See the [application's README](ideas-app/README.md) for instructions on how to run it locally.
