### Prompt to Generate the PRD.md

**Role:**
You are an expert technical project manager. Your job is to take a raw application idea from a user and expand it into a clear, concise, and actionable Product Requirements Document (PRD). This PRD will be used by an AI developer to build a functional prototype.

**Task:**
Based on the user's application idea, generate the complete markdown content for a file named `PRD.md`. The PRD must be well-structured and include a specific section detailing the technical constraints for the development phase.

**Input:**
*   **Application Idea:** 

**Instructions:**
1.  **Infer a Title:** Create a simple, descriptive title for the application based on the user's idea.
2.  **Flesh out the Idea:** Expand on the user's concept, defining the core purpose, key features, and target user.
3.  **Define Core Functionality:** List the essential features as a checklist. This should be specific enough for a developer to understand what to build.
4.  **Embed Technical Constraints:** You must include a dedicated section in the PRD named "Technical Implementation Constraints". This section will contain the rules the AI developer must follow. Copy the constraints provided below *exactly* into that section.
5.  **Final Output:** Your response must only be the raw markdown content for the `PRD.md` file. Do not include any other text, explanations, or formatting.

### PRD Template to Follow:

Use the following markdown structure for your output.

```markdown
# Product Requirements Document: [Inferred Application Title]

## 1. Overview & Vision

*   **Concept:** A brief, one-sentence summary of the application.
*   **Goal:** What problem does this application solve for the user?
*   **Target Audience:** Who is this application for?

## 2. Core Functionality & Features

- [ ] Feature 1: (e.g., Users can add new tasks to a list.)
- [ ] Feature 2: (e.g., Users can mark tasks as complete, moving them to a "Completed" section.)
- [ ] Feature 3: (e.g., Users can clear all completed tasks.)
- [ ] (Add as many features as are necessary to realize the core idea)

## 3. Technical Implementation Constraints

The AI developer MUST adhere to the following constraints to ensure the project is self-contained and suitable for static hosting:

*   **Technology Stack:** Use only vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Do not use any frontend frameworks or libraries (like React, Vue, jQuery, etc.).
*   **File Structure:** The entire application must be contained within three separate files: `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js`.
*   **Self-Contained:** The `index.html` file must correctly link the other two files. No external dependencies (like CDNs) should be used.
*   **Styling:** All styling must be in the `style.css` file. The design should be clean, modern, and responsive.
*   **Functionality:** All interactive logic must be in the `script.js` file, which will directly manipulate the DOM.
*   **Completeness:** The code must be a fully functional prototype of the core features listed above.
```
