## Course of Action

Based on the investigation, the following actions were taken:

1.  **Disable extraneous workflows:** The workflows that were not part of the original repository state (`gemini-dispatch.yml`, `gemini-invoke.yml`, `gemini-review.yml`) have been moved to the `.disabled` directory.
2.  **Restore original workflows:** The two original workflows, `gemini-cli.yml` and `gemini-pr-review.yml`, have been restored to their state from commit `993ba1b`.

## Investigation of `gemini-cli.yml` and `gemini-pr-review.yml`

An investigation was conducted to analyze the changes to `gemini-cli.yml` and `gemini-pr-review.yml` between commit `993ba1b` and the commit `f16d887` (the commit identified as the "accidental overwrite").

The investigation found that only one commit in this range modified these files:

*   **Commit:** `44c9947` (17:28)
    *   **Action:** DELETE
    *   **Description:** This commit deleted both `gemini-cli.yml` and `gemini-pr-review.yml`. The commit message is "chore(workflows): Disable legacy Gemini workflows".

It appears the files were intentionally deleted in this commit, and not overwritten as initially thought. The commit `f16d887` did not modify these files.
