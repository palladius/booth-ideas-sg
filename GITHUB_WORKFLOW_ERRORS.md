## Course of Action

Based on the investigation, the following actions were taken:

1.  **Disable extraneous workflows:** The workflows that were not part of the original repository state (`gemini-dispatch.yml`, `gemini-invoke.yml`, `gemini-review.yml`) have been moved to the `.disabled` directory.
2.  **Restore original workflows:** The two original workflows, `gemini-cli.yml` and `gemini-pr-review.yml`, have been restored to their state from commit `993ba1b`.
