** Idea: **



@gemini-cli please (1) create "PRD.md" using the <project_root>/prompts/prd.md file (2) ask the user via an issue comment on the issue if they want to proceed with a plan to implement this. Also ask user for their nickname, and an emoji. If nothing is returned, you pick your fav emoji but be adamant you need a nickname.
